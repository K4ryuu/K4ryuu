# Hello, World! 🚀

### About Me

👨‍💻 I immersed myself in the world of game development as a passionate hobbyist. I dedicated extensive effort to working on predominantly free projects for CS:GO and TF2, and my contributions were widely embraced by numerous game servers, leaving a significant impact on the Source Engine-based community.

💼 Today, I've transitioned into the role of a DevOps Engineer at a television and radio station hosting company. In this role, I predominantly focus on software development and the maintenance of my projects.

🌐 I'm not just a 9-to-5 developer; I'm committed to continuous growth. I'm always open to new opportunities, including paid requests, but even free ones, to expand my portfolio and leave a lasting legacy in the digital realm.

🏆 Proficient in a diverse range of technologies, I'm ever-eager to explore new horizons.

🌍 When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new destinations or enjoying underground raves in unconventional places.

- 🖥️ **Front-End:** React, C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
